## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find MATLAB code examples for signal processing, including techniques like the Fourier Transform, filtering, and more. We've provided code and explanations to help you understand and apply these techniques.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the MATLAB code, you'll need to install Octave, a MATLAB-compatible open-source software. Octave provides a convenient environment for running MATLAB scripts.

## Installation

### Octave Installation

You can install Octave on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Follow the instructions for your specific operating system:

- **Windows**: Download the Windows installer from the [Octave website](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html) and follow the installation instructions.

- **macOS**: You can install Octave on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Open your terminal and run:

- **Linux (Ubuntu)**: On Ubuntu, you can install Octave using apt:


### Clone the Repository

You'll also need to clone this repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:


## Usage

Navigate to the repository's directory and use Octave to run the MATLAB scripts. For example, to run the Fourier Transform code:

```matlab
octave FourierTransform.m
